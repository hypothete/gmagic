# GMagic

A vector image editor

## Purpose

GMagic is a simple polygon and polyline editor, developed to prepare graphics for use on the PICO-8. By using only lines and polygons to compose images, the compressed image data can be shared with PICO-8 renderers and use very little cart space for complex animations. It's basically an extremely simple vector graphics editor.

GMagic is inspired by the Graphics Magician Picture Painter, software used in the late 70s and early 80s to design graphics for adventure games and other programs of the time.

## Use

```bash
  yarn

  yarn start
```

This should start the editor at localhost:3000.
